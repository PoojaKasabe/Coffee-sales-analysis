# Coffee-sales-analysis

## Project Objective

To analyze coffee sales data and uncover patterns in customer preferences, pricing strategies, and payment behavior, with the goal of generating actionable business insights for improving sales performance and customer satisfaction.

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
- Git & GitHub

## Key Highlights
- Card payments dominate (92%+ share), often offering better pricing.
- Highest sales occur at 10 AM, with a secondary peak at 7 PM.
- Wednesday shows lowest average prices for multiple coffee types.
- Most ordered drink: Americano with Milk; highest revenue: Latte.

 ## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended:

- **Promote card payments** further by offering loyalty rewards or small discounts, as they already dominate and show lower transaction costs.
- **Run targeted offers on Tuesdays and Wednesdays**, when prices are low â€” to maximize customer traffic and drive volume.
- **Stock up on Latte, Americano with Milk, and Cappuccino**, as these are the top-performing drinks in both popularity and revenue.
- **Introduce espresso-focused promos in the morning** (around 10 AM) and evening (around 7 PM) to capitalize on peak sales hours.
- **Monitor weekend pricing** for items like Cocoa and Hot Chocolate, which tend to spike â€” and consider bundling to improve value perception.
